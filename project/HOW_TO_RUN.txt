=== How to Run the Air Quality Prediction App ===

OPTION 1: First Time Setup (Do this first!)
-------------------------------------------
If you have just downloaded this project or moved it to a new computer:

1. Double-click "setup_new_user.bat".
2. Wait for it to finish. It will:
   - Check and install Python if missing.
   - Create a hidden folder `tf_env` for dependencies.
   - Install all required libraries (Flask, TensorFlow, etc.).
   - Automatically launch the app when done.
3. If successful, it will tell you to open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
4. If it fails, the window will stay open with an error message. Check your internet connection.

OPTION 2: Regular Use (The Easy Way)
------------------------------------
Once you have done the setup once, you can just do this every time:

1. Double-click "run_app.bat".
2. A terminal window will open to start the server.
3. Open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
   (Keep the terminal window open while using the app).

OPTION 3: The Manual Way (For Developers)
-----------------------------------------
If you prefer using the command line (Terminal / PowerShell):

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   For Windows PowerShell:
     .\tf_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   For Command Prompt (cmd):
     .\tf_env\Scripts\activate.bat
3. Run the application:
     python app.py
4. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- "Flask module not found": Run "setup_new_user.bat" again to ensure dependencies are installed.
- App closes immediately: Check if you have the `tf_env` folder. If not, run Option 1.
- Port already in use: Make sure you don't have another instance of the app running.
